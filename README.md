Visualize spreadsheet formulas (and, in the future, entire spreadsheets) as interactive graphs and calculate the value at each step.

> [!NOTE]
> This application is in the early stages of development.

- [Storybook](https://sheetflow-storybook.patrickszela.workers.dev/)

## Features

- Formula Visualization - visualize spreadsheet formulas as interactive graphs
- Step-by-Step Calculation - see the calculated value for every part of the formula
- Live Dependency Editing - automatically detects all formula dependencies and allows you to change their values on the fly
- Fully Private - all calculations and data processing happen directly in your browser; no data ever leaves your device
- Light and Dark Mode
- Open Source

## Roadmap

While there's still much to implement, here's a list of key planned features:

- Visualize multiple formulas in a tile- and tab-based interface
- Improve compatibility with popular spreadsheet applications
- Load and visualize entire spreadsheet files
- Integrate different calculation engines
- Construct formulas using the graph interface
- Implement as an add-on for popular spreadsheet applications
- Add support for internationalization
- And much more!

## License

SheetFlow is an open source software currently released under GPLv3 (GNU General Public License v3.0). The long-term plan is to re-license the core application under the MIT license, while the calculation engines will retain their respective licenses.
